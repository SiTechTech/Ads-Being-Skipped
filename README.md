# Ads-Being-Skipped
## This is for YouTube skipping ads, it works by using html on the youtube and changes the non-skippable to skippalbe essentially just speeding up the time the skip button appers on screen. Adding both of these to the chrome extension will auto skip ads and pop-ups ads besides the ads that are not skippable, that said you will want to add any pictures or anything else if you do want to spice it up other then that you can just copy and paste from here and it will work
